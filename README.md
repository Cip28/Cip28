- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cip28
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology, especially the visual part of it, because I like to create new and attractive things using my imagination.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my frontend skills of JavaScript/TypeScript, creating React mini-projects at a beginner level of difficulty. I'm also learning Mixed Reality Extension SDK by applying functionalities through TypeScript to 3D models in AltspaceVR. 
- ðŸ“« If you want to reach me, you can email me at the address cip.barbu28@gmail.com
