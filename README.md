- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cip28
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology, especially the visual part of it, because I like to create new and attractive things using my imagination.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my frontend skills of HTML/CSS & Javascript at a medium level of difficulty, but I'm also looking forward to learn the frameworks of Javascript, like React and Angular. 
- ðŸ“« If you want to reach me, you can email me at the address cip.barbu28@gmail.com
